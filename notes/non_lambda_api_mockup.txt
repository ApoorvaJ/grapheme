Goals:

    1. Implement a simple render graph API
    2. No lambdas, because lambdas come with unavoidably complex lifetimes
    3. No async/await.
       Pros:
           Both, async/await and render graphs involve composing a DAG and then
           kicking it off.
       Cons:
           Too abstracted away. I think the level of superstition involved is
           not worth the mild syntactic sugar.
    4. No reordering of passes
    5. No profile-guided optimization ambitions

Questions:

    1. What happens if a declared pass is never executed?
    A: Nothing? :P
       This might lead to bad graph execution, since state transitions will be
       encoded, because the declaration exists. It might be worth throwing a
       warning during the graph's drop.

    2. What happens if order of declaration differs from order of execution?
    A: We validate the pass handle provided to graph.begin_pass(), and check
       whether it agrees with the declaration order. We can also use this to
       solve problem 1.
       To begin with, a graph can just maintain a simple queue of pass hashes,
       and dequeue them as passes are executed. Later, async compute will need
       more sophisticated tracking on this front.

    3. What happens if the user tries to add_pass after a begin_pass has been
       executed?
    A: This is invalid behavior. We make it impossible by making the
       graph_builder and the graph two distinct types.

TODOs:

    1. graph.end_pass() followed by the next graph.begin_pass(), could be
       conflated into a single call. I currently don't think that this has any
       perf implications. I think that keeping the begin/end_pass() calls
       separate is more meaningful semantically. More investigation needed.

/* Step 1: Declaration */
let mut graph_builder = GraphBuilder::new(gpu);
// Here, add_pass() returns a hash based on the passed inputs
let pass_0 = graph_builder.add_pass(
    "gbuffer",
    vec![], // inputs
    vec![gbuffer_a, // outputs
    gbuffer_b, gbuffer_c],
    Some(depth)
);
let pass_1 = graph_builder.add_pass(
    "lighting",
    vec![gbuffer_a, gbuffer_b, gbuffer_c], // inputs
    vec![scene_color], // outputs
    None
);

/* Step 2: Building */
let graph = Graph::new(graph_builder); // Moves graph_builder

/* Step 3: Execution */
graph.begin_pass(pass_0, cmd_buf);
device.cmd_draw_indexed(cmd_buf, mesh_0...);
device.cmd_draw_indexed(cmd_buf, mesh_1...);
graph.end_pass(cmd_buf);

graph.begin_pass(pass_1, cmd_buf);
device.cmd_draw_full_screen_triangle(cmd_buf, ...);
graph.end_pass(cmd_buf);
